# netdata configuration for aggregating data from remote hosts
#
# API keys authorize a pair of sending-receiving netdata servers.
# Once their communication is authorized, they can exchange metrics for any
# number of hosts.
#
# You can generate API keys, with the linux command: uuidgen

    # Skip Certificate verification?
    #
    # The netdata slave is configurated to avoid invalid SSL/TLS certificate,
    # so certificates that are self-signed or expired will stop the streaming.
    # Case the server certificate is not valid, you can enable the use of
    # 'bad' certificates setting the next option as 'yes'.
    #
    #ssl skip certificate verification = yes

    # Certificate Authority Path
    #
    # OpenSSL has a default directory where the known certificates are stored,
    # case it is necessary it is possible to change this rule using the variable
    # "CApath"
    #
    #CApath = /etc/ssl/certs/

    # Certificate Authority file
    #
    # When the Netdata master has certificate, that is not recognized as valid,
    # we can add this certificate in the list of known certificates in CApath
    # and give for Netdata as argument.
    #
    #CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/cert.pem

    # The API_KEY to use (as the sender)

    # filter the charts to be streamed
    # netdata SIMPLE PATTERN:
    # - space separated list of patterns (use \ to include spaces in patterns)
    # - use * as wildcard, any number of times within each pattern
    # - prefix a pattern with ! for a negative match (ie not stream the charts it matches)
    # - the order of patterns is important (left to right)
    # To send all except a few, use: !this !that *   (ie append a wildcard pattern)
    send charts matching = *

    # The buffer to use for sending metrics.
    # 1MB is good for 10-20 seconds of data, so increase this if you expect latencies.
    # The buffer is flushed on reconnects (this will not prevent gaps at the charts).
    buffer size bytes = 1048576

    # If the connection fails, or it disconnects,
    # retry after that many seconds.
    reconnect delay seconds = 5
